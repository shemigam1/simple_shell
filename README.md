This very "simple" shell collects input from the keyboard using the getline function, tokenizes it using strtok and inplements it

to use the simple shell program,
clone the repository to your computer
and compile your files with this command
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
the shell should work like this in interactive mode
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$

if you have any suggestions please create a pull request
git readm commite
