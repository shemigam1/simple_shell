This very "simple" shell collects input from the keyboard using the getline function, tokenizes it using strtok and inplements it

to use the simple shell program,
clone the repository to your computer
and compile your files with this command
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
